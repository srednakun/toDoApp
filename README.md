# To-Do-App
To do list web app using html,css,and jquery.

This is a web app that allows the user to make a list of things to do. 
The add, edit, and remove features can be done directly in the list. 
There are clickable add and save buttons. When clicking save, changes 
to the list are saved locally. A scroll feature becomes available when
the list is too long.

Open the webpage by right clicking the html document and open with a browser.
